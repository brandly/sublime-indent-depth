# Sublime Text 2: Indent Depth

> change how many spaces are used to indent a file

i wanted a project to consistently use two space indents, but it was using four spaces in some files

convert to two spaces by hitting `cmd + shift + 2` or to four with `cmd + shift + 4`

it makes use of [this strategy](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14773274/1614967) to handle the conversion
